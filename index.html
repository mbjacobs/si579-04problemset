                    <h4><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/20/politics/amanda-gorman-inaugural-poem-transcript/index.html">The Hill We Climb</a> by Amanda Gorman (2021)</h4>
                    <p>
                        When day comes we ask ourselves,
                        where can we find light in this never-ending shade?
                        The loss we carry,
                        a sea we must wade
                        We've braved the belly of the beast
                        We've learned that quiet isn't always peace
                        And the norms and notions
                        of what just is
                        Isn't always just-ice
                        And yet the dawn is ours
                        before we knew it
                        Somehow we do it
                        Somehow we've weathered and witnessed
                        a nation that isn't broken
                        but simply unfinished
                        We the successors of a country and a time
                        Where a skinny Black girl
                        descended from slaves and raised by a single mother
                        can dream of becoming president
                        only to find herself reciting for one
                        And yes we are far from polished
                        far from pristine
                        but that doesn't mean we are
                        striving to form a union that is perfect
                        We are striving to forge a union with purpose
                        To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and
                        conditions of man
                        And so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us
                        but what stands before us
                        We close the divide because we know, to put our future first,
                        we must first put our differences aside
                        We lay down our arms
                        so we can reach out our arms
                        to one another
                        We seek harm to none and harmony for all
                        Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true:
                        That even as we grieved, we grew
                        That even as we hurt, we hoped
                        That even as we tired, we tried
                        That we'll forever be tied together, victorious
                        Not because we will never again know defeat
                        but because we will never again sow division
                        Scripture tells us to envision
                        that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
                        And no one shall make them afraid
                        If we're to live up to our own time
                        Then victory won't lie in the blade
                        But in all the bridges we've made
                        That is the promise to glade
                        The hill we climb
                        If only we dare
                        It's because being American is more than a pride we inherit,
                        it's the past we step into
                        and how we repair it
                        We've seen a force that would shatter our nation
                        rather than share it
                        Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy
                        And this effort very nearly succeeded
                        But while democracy can be periodically delayed
                        it can never be permanently defeated
                        In this truth
                        in this faith we trust
                        For while we have our eyes on the future
                        history has its eyes on us
                        This is the era of just redemption
                        We feared at its inception
                        We did not feel prepared to be the heirs
                        of such a terrifying hour
                        but within it we found the power
                        to author a new chapter
                        To offer hope and laughter to ourselves
                        So while once we asked,
                        how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe?
                        Now we assert
                        How could catastrophe possibly prevail over us?
                        We will not march back to what was
                        but move to what shall be
                        A country that is bruised but whole,
                        benevolent but bold,
                        fierce and free
                        We will not be turned around
                        or interrupted by intimidation
                        because we know our inaction and inertia
                        will be the inheritance of the next generation
                        Our blunders become their burdens
                        But one thing is certain:
                        If we merge mercy with might,
                        and might with right,
                        then love becomes our legacy
                        and change our children's birthright
                        So let us leave behind a country
                        better than the one we were left with
                        Every breath from my bronze-pounded chest,
                        we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one
                        We will rise from the gold-limbed hills of the west,
                        we will rise from the windswept northeast
                        where our forefathers first realized revolution
                        We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the midwestern states,
                        we will rise from the sunbaked south
                        We will rebuild, reconcile and recover
                        and every known nook of our nation and
                        every corner called our country,
                        our people diverse and beautiful will emerge,
                        battered and beautiful
                        When day comes we step out of the shade,
                        aflame and unafraid
                        The new dawn blooms as we free it
                        For there is always light,
                        if only we're brave enough to see it
                        If only we're brave enough to be it
